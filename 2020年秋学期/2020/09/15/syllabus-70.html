<meta name="description" content="Goals of this course To become able to take advantage of computer networks in SFC. To acquire basic computer skills (touch typing, file operation, etc.). To become able to offer information using web. To acquire basic programming skills in Python. In the first half (1st – 6th week) of this course, we study about CNS (Campus Network System). In the second half (7th – 12th week), we study about Python programming. Evaluation criteria We have no examination in this semester because it is difficult to conduct online examinations. Evaluation criteria and their allotment of marks are as follows: Report (40points): You need to write a literature review and discussion on a designated topic related to information and communication technology. Class performance (60points): Weekly assignments and class participations will be evaluated. We place more importance on Python programming exercises. Your grade will be decided by applying the following table to the sum of your marks. Note If we have FIT2 classes on campus in 2021, we will have an exam for the touch typing skill. Please practice hard!   Zoom Meeting https://keio-univ.zoom.us/j/83098705189?pwd=UklIdWRoVkJWRldCQk15eFdON3Fzdz09 Meeting ID: 830 9870 5189Passcode: 134001 Materials https://itclass.sfc.keio.ac.jp/text/info1-2020-9/ https://cns-guide.sfc.keio.ac.jp/" />
