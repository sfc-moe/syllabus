TICAD has been the centerpiece of Japan&#39;s policy in Africa since its inception in 1992.As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized TICAD VII 2019, there are many issues to consider in order to realize the goals of increased trade,aid,connection between Japan and Africa under COVID19. Although the results of previous conferences had been constructive, there remains an &quot;information gap&quot; between the policies and intents of the Japanese government and business community, and the response and knowledge of the Japanese citizen as to the recent history, the varied cultures and issues in Africa today. By investigating both large-scale and small scale investment, tourism and educational, in particular agricultural connections and N.G.O. endeavors and the goals and effects of the Japanese policies themselves, the course will explore methods by which the goals of the government&#39;s policies in Africa can be made accessible to Japanese society as a whole. *This course was supposed to be offered as the combination of full-online and SBC academic camp but considering the present situation of COVID19, we have to give up SBC stay. We will be flexible to change the program and if the situation improves we will come back to the program combining SBC academic camp and on-line. Thank you for your understanding.The course will begin with a short series of introductory lectures on the history of Africa, and the Africa&#39;s part in the development of agricultural system along with visits from Japanese nationals who have recently returned from projects in Africa.There are many people from African countires to join training sessions on agricalture in Japan. Especially this semester under COVID19, we persue our susutainable global connection between African Countries and Japan focusing on the cultures, community building, agriculture. So in order to realize our goals everybody should know and experience gateways to Japanese agriculture in our neighborhood. Then you are ready to understand African countries in reality.The course will then focus on some countries: South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, and 2 or 3 other countries. Although all the lectures are offered on line, we reorganized class as combination of on-line lectures and Study Camp at SBC + Farm experience on the farm field in Endo Area around SFC campus.The aim of this course is to be interactive and experience-based(agriculture) even courses on Fridays are offered on-line. We will welcome guest speakers both from African countries and from Japan which means you will have many opportunities to meet diversity of people, have active group discussions, make some projects with your friends, realize the projects, have actual fieldwork on the farm, even on-line. As a goal of the course, you persue and make actual project plans for you, the next generation, to become friends and to be sustainable partners for the future.   授業シラバス 主題と目標／授業の手法など The course will begin with a short series of introductory lectures on the history of Africa, and the Africa&#39;s part in the development of agricultural system along with visits from Japanese nationals who have recently returned from projects in Africa.There are many people from African countires to join training sessions on agricalture in Japan.

TICAD has been the centerpiece of Japan&#39;s policy in Africa since its inception in 1992.As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized TICAD VII 2019, there are many issues to consider in order to realize the goals of increased trade,aid,connection between Japan and Africa under COVID19. Although the results of previous conferences had been constructive, there remains an &quot;information gap&quot; between the policies and intents of the Japanese government and business community, and the response and knowledge of the Japanese citizen as to the recent history, the varied cultures and issues in Africa today. By investigating both large-scale and small scale investment, tourism and educational, in particular agricultural connections and N.G.O. endeavors and the goals and effects of the Japanese policies themselves, the course will explore methods by which the goals of the government&#39;s policies in Africa can be made accessible to Japanese society as a whole. *This course was supposed to be offered as the combination of full-online and SBC academic camp but considering the present situation of COVID19, we have to give up SBC stay. We will be flexible to change the program and if the situation improves we will come back to the program combining SBC academic camp and on-line. Thank you for your understanding.The course will begin with a short series of introductory lectures on the history of Africa, and the Africa&#39;s part in the development of agricultural system along with visits from Japanese nationals who have recently returned from projects in Africa.There are many people from African countires to join training sessions on agricalture in Japan. Especially this semester under COVID19, we persue our susutainable global connection between African Countries and Japan focusing on the cultures, community building, agriculture. So in order to realize our goals everybody should know and experience gateways to Japanese agriculture in our neighborhood. Then you are ready to understand African countries in reality.The course will then focus on some countries: South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, and 2 or 3 other countries. Although all the lectures are offered on line, we reorganized class as combination of on-line lectures and Study Camp at SBC + Farm experience on the farm field in Endo Area around SFC campus.The aim of this course is to be interactive and experience-based(agriculture) even courses on Fridays are offered on-line. We will welcome guest speakers both from African countries and from Japan which means you will have many opportunities to meet diversity of people, have active group discussions, make some projects with your friends, realize the projects, have actual fieldwork on the farm, even on-line. As a goal of the course, you persue and make actual project plans for you, the next generation, to become friends and to be sustainable partners for the future.   授業シラバス 主題と目標／授業の手法など The course will begin with a short series of introductory lectures on the history of Africa, and the Africa&#39;s part in the development of agricultural system along with visits from Japanese nationals who have recently returned from projects in Africa.There are many people from African countires to join training sessions on agricalture in Japan.
