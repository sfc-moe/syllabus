<p>The anticipation of new possibilities and hopes that campus life has to offer enthralls university students in their new environment each year.<br><br>However, many students experience indisposition, such as difficulty getting along with new friends and academic relationships, disorderly dietary and sleeping habits or apathy following a loss of purpose, during the process of adjusting to their new cultural environment.<br><br>Additionally, the student’s burden includes items that induce disruptive conditions, such as extended periods of computer operation, group work lasting late into nights, peer pressure at parties and midterm and final requirements. In addition, support from the student’s family may not be as readily available, leaving the student more vulnerable to the stress of adjustment.<br><br>The student must assume responsibility for managing his/her life habits and maintaining his/her own health.<br><br>Physical and Mental Health for Campus Life will consist of six sessions aimed at acquiring basic skills and theory in order to maintain physical and mental soundness that will ensure a fulfilling campus life. Although the student may be familiar with much of the lecture material, the important aspect is that the theory be applied practically.<br><br>To this end, through the topics discussed during sessions, students are expected to re-evaluate their health conditions or problems and recapture these health issues from a personal perspective. Further and finally, students are expected to present a resolutive plan addressing their own health shortcomings, or a personal “Wellness Plan”, to lay a sound foundation for a fulfilling self-realization that would persist past his graduation.<br><br>Intercultural Adjustment I-IV: There will be 4 interactive sessions on intercultural<br>adjustment. The goal of this section is to understand the mechanism of<br>adjusting to a new environment, explore one’s multicultural identity and<br>build resilience to thrive in a global world. The students will be asked<br>to participate in the experiential activities based on the<br>multi-disciplinary approaches (mainly intercultural communication and<br>psychology). Our approach includes emotional intelligence and mindfulness<br>as well as cognitive and analytical approach. (Please wear comfortable<br>clothes.).</p>

<p><u>＃2　Intercultural Adjustment II: Intercultural adjustment process, multi-cultural identities and stress management</u></p>
<p><u>Oct. 19  On Campus/Online</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The students will learn and explore about the process of intercultural<br>adjustment, multicultural identities and stress management. The purposes<br>of this session are to understand one’s own psycho-physical reactions to the unknown, and to identify which behavioral options allow one to thrive in intercultural settings. One of the keys to successful adjustment is “the ability to transform negative emotion to positive energy” (Jackie Wasilewski). We will practice stress management exercises and explore ways to thrive in the course of adapting to a new environment, and explore ways to communicate with ourselves, with others, and with our environment to make a successful transformation. Students will start group work.</p>
