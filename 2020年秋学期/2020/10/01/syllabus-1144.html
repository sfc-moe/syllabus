How can we understand the unity and diversity found throughout the world&#39;s music? Scientific attempts to answer these questions through cross-­cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence with the power of modern computational methods. In this class, we will explore the past, present, and future of all the world&#39;s music (including folk, pop, and classical music) using comparative and computational methods.  Bio: Patrick Savage has directed the CompMusic Lab for comparative and computational musicology since he joined SFC in 2018. He received his MSc in Psychology from McMaster University, PhD in Ethnomusicology from Tokyo University of the Arts, and did a postdoc in Anthropology at the University of Oxford. His research focusing on using science to understand cross-cultural diversity has been featured in high-profile outlets including Nature, Science, The New York Times, and The Economist. He loves all music, and has won national competitions in Japanese folk song, sung in a funk band, and directed an a capella group that placed 3rd in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. On the rare occasions when he’s not working or parenting, he likes to drink coffee and play basketball. Entry song: Al Green - Let’s Stay Together (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COiIC3A0ROM) Week 2  (10/8) : Surviving in the polar regions Megumu TUJIMOTO Website: https://vu.sfc.keio.ac.jp/faculty_profile/cgi/f_profile_e.cgi?id=5825d6baed6b0e77 Abstract: How many organisms do you know living in the polar regions? Penguins? Whales? Seals? Polar bears?? YES, indeed, they live in the Antarctic or in the Arctic. But, what else? There are many animals and plants over there surviving in the cold. In this class, we will take a quick tour to the Japanese Antarctic station and to the Canadian sub-Arctic islands, and observe some animals and plants in the environment. Then, some of the keys of the Antarctic tardigrades to survival in the harsh environment will be introduced. Bio: Back in 2003, Megumu met “Antarctic Science” at University of Tasmania in Hobart, where she was taking courses for a semester as an exchange student from University of California. She was so much fascinated by the organisms living in the Antarctic environments and she started a part-time job at National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo after she had received B.S. from UCSD in 2004. Since then, she has been involved in various research projects in Antarctica and also in the Arctic, received Ph.D in Polar Science from SOKENDAI, and ended up happily being a faculty of SFC from 2019 spring. Her research topics cover a broad range of animals and plants living in Antarctica, but sorry, not the charismatic animals such as penguins and seals, nor polar bears in the Arctic. Her recent research interest is the ecology of tardigrades living in the harsh terrestrial environments in Antarctica. Entry song: Weezer – Photograph (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q4K8BOURQg) Week 3 (10/15) : The Circle of Life Mika KUNIEDA Website  https://sdpe.sfc.keio.ac.jp/ https://www.ztwist.design/niger-baby-wrap Abstract:  We’ll start class by sharing thoughts about the 2 assigned articles. Then let me introduce you to some examples from my field; the African continent. From East Africa, you’ll hear about the balance of environment and human (economic) activities, abilities and disabilities as well as politics as an art of pursuing wellbeing (for all?). From West Africa, you’ll hear about data analysis and behavior change communication work, a pursuit of science for the wellbeing for all. You’ll learn that this experience leads to a belief and action for low-cost, self-owned solutions as well as design and nudges as a way forward.  Bio: Mika Kondo Kunieda married a fellow Keio graduate and has two children your ages. She has worked in Africa for over 20 years, as NGO worker, JICA consultant, World Bank consultant, JICA expert and UNICEF staff. She focuses on finding practical, low-cost, effective development resources for Africa. Her goals through her research and work in the field are social justice and health equity. Mika has a BA in Policy Management from Keio and a MSc in Social Policy and Planning in Developing Countries from LSE. She was Takemi Fellow for International Health at the Harvard School of Public Health 2017-2018.  Entry song: Ludwig Göransson ft. Baaba Maal - Wakanda [from &quot;Black Panther (Original Score)&quot;] https://youtu.be/WMFAsidiQfc Week 4 (10/22):  AI and the future of human creativity Nao TOKUI Website   cclab.sfc.keio.ac.jp  www.naotokui.net    Abstract: As the social implementation of AI progresses, people started saying that creativity is the last holy grail left for humans. But is it?  In 2017, a painting generated by AI was sold at one of the most prestigious auctions. Music streaming services seek to start streaming AI-generated music. Will AI make human artists and musicians redundant?  In this lecture, I&#39;d like to introduce some of my works and other contemporary artists utilizing AI in their creative endeavors. I&#39;ll try to shed light on the two aspects of AI: a mirror reflecting our creative processes and a tool for enhancing it.  Bio: Nao Tokui is an artist, researcher, and associate professor at Keio University. Tokui received his Ph.D. from The University of Tokyo on his research on Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence (AI). He has been exploring the potential expansion of human creativity through the use of AI. His recent works include a collaboration with Brian Eno and AI DJ Project, where a Machine Learning-based DJ plays alongside a human DJ (Tokui, himself), taking turns selecting and playing one song at a time. His works have been exhibited at New York MoMA, Barbican Centre(London), InterCommunication Center(Tokyo), and more.  Entry song   Nao Tokui - Pan Pacific https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvh3u6zPmtw   Week 5 (10/29) :  The science of the haptic senses Masashi NAKATANI Website: https://touchlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/  Abstract: In five senses, touch is the least understood research area comparing with other modalities. This is because sense of touch is fundamental so that usually people do not pay much attention to touch. Recent scientific challenges have gradually revealed the mystery of touch. This mini-lecture is going to provide an overview of current haptic science and technology. In addition, we discuss some of perceptual illusions, which may facilitate the understanding of information processing in somatosensation. If a person could find a perceptual phenomenon such as perceptual illusion, the perceptual mechanism of our sense modality is fully appreciated, especially in vision and auditory science.

<p><u>Week 1 (10/1) : The science of the world’s music　</u></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Patrick SAVAGE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>What is music, and why did it evolve? How can we understand the unity and diversity found throughout the world's music? Scientific attempts to answer these questions through cross-­cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence with the power of modern computational methods. In this class, we will explore the past, present, and future of all the world's music (including folk, pop, and classical music) using comparative and computational methods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Bio: </strong>Patrick Savage has directed the CompMusic Lab for comparative and computational musicology since he joined SFC in 2018. He received his MSc in Psychology from McMaster University, PhD in Ethnomusicology from Tokyo University of the Arts, and did a postdoc in Anthropology at the University of Oxford. His research focusing on using science to understand cross-cultural diversity has been featured in high-profile outlets including <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i>, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, and <i>The Economist</i>. He loves all music, and has won national competitions in Japanese folk song, sung in a funk band, and directed an a capella group that placed 3rd in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. On the rare occasions when he’s not working or parenting, he likes to drink coffee and play basketball.</p>

<p><u>Week 2  (10/8) : </u><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surviving in the polar regions</span></p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>How many organisms do you know living in the polar regions? Penguins? Whales? Seals? Polar bears?? YES, indeed, they live in the Antarctic or in the Arctic. But, what else? There are many animals and plants over there surviving in the cold. In this class, we will take a quick tour to the Japanese Antarctic station and to the Canadian sub-Arctic islands, and observe some animals and plants in the environment. Then, some of the keys of the Antarctic tardigrades to survival in the harsh environment will be introduced.</p>
<p><strong>Bio: </strong>Back in 2003, Megumu met “Antarctic Science” at University of Tasmania in Hobart, where she was taking courses for a semester as an exchange student from University of California. She was so much fascinated by the organisms living in the Antarctic environments and she started a part-time job at National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo after she had received B.S. from UCSD in 2004. Since then, she has been involved in various research projects in Antarctica and also in the Arctic, received Ph.D in Polar Science from SOKENDAI, and ended up happily being a faculty of SFC from 2019 spring. Her research topics cover a broad range of animals and plants living in Antarctica, but sorry, not the charismatic animals such as penguins and seals, nor polar bears in the Arctic. Her recent research interest is the ecology of tardigrades living in the harsh terrestrial environments in Antarctica.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong>We’ll start class by sharing thoughts about the 2 assigned articles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Then let me introduce you to some examples from my field; the African continent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">From East Africa, you’ll hear about the balance of environment and human (economic) activities, abilities and disabilities as well as politics as an art of pursuing wellbeing (for all?). From West Africa, you’ll hear about data analysis and behavior change communication work, a pursuit of science for the wellbeing for all. You’ll learn that this experience leads to a belief and action for low-cost, self-owned solutions as well as design and nudges as a way forward.</span> </p>
<p><strong>Bio: </strong>Mika Kondo Kunieda married a fellow Keio graduate and has two children your ages. She has worked in Africa for over 20 years, as NGO worker, JICA consultant, World Bank consultant, JICA expert and UNICEF staff. She focuses on finding practical, low-cost, effective development resources for Africa. Her goals through her research and work in the field are social justice and health equity. Mika has a BA in Policy Management from Keio and a MSc in Social Policy and Planning in Developing Countries from LSE. She was Takemi Fellow for International Health at the Harvard School of Public Health 2017-2018.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Abstract: </strong>As the social implementation of AI progresses, people started saying that creativity is the last holy grail left for humans. But is it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 2017, a painting generated by AI was sold at one of the most prestigious auctions. Music streaming services seek to start streaming AI-generated music. Will AI make human artists and musicians redundant? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">In this lecture, I'd like to introduce some of my works and other contemporary artists utilizing AI in their creative endeavors. I'll try to shed light on the two aspects of AI: a mirror reflecting our creative processes and a tool for enhancing it.</span> </p>
<p><strong>Bio: </strong>Nao Tokui is an artist, researcher, and associate professor at Keio University. Tokui received his Ph.D. from The University of Tokyo on his research on Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence (AI). He has been exploring the potential expansion of human creativity through the use of AI. His recent works include a collaboration with Brian Eno and AI DJ Project, where a Machine Learning-based DJ plays alongside a human DJ (Tokui, himself), taking turns selecting and playing one song at a time. His works have been exhibited at New York MoMA, Barbican Centre(London), InterCommunication Center(Tokyo), and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://touchlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/">https://touchlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Abstract: </strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">In five senses, touch is the least understood research area comparing with other modalities. This is because sense of touch is fundamental so that usually people do not pay much attention to touch. Recent scientific challenges have gradually revealed the mystery of touch. This mini-lecture is going to provide an overview of current haptic science and technology. In addition, we discuss some of perceptual illusions, which may facilitate the understanding of information processing in somatosensation.</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">If a person could find a perceptual phenomenon such as perceptual illusion, the perceptual mechanism of our sense modality is fully appreciated, especially in vision and auditory science.</span></p>
